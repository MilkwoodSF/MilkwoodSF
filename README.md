### "A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg."  ~ Robert Sapolsky <br>

### “I hold a beast, an angel, and a madman in me, and my enquiry is as to their working, and my problem is their subjugation and victory, down throw and upheaval, and my effort is their self-expression.”  ~ Dylan Thomas, author of Under Milk Wood
